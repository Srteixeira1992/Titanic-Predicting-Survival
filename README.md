# Titanic-Predicting-Survival

This project aims to predict the survival probability of passengers aboard the Titanic based on various features such as age, class, sex, and embarkation location. Using the Titanic dataset, I applied data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and machine learning models to draw insights and make predictions.

### Tools and technologies used:
  Python
  Pandas for data manipulation
  Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
  Scikit-learn for building machine learning models

### Key steps:
  Data cleaning: Handling missing values and transforming categorical variables.
  Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing data distributions and correlations.
  Model training: Using classification algorithms like Logistic Regression and Decision Trees to predict survival.
